## Microsoft Extensions Azure App Configuration

### 2.0.0-preview-010050001-38 - October 03, 2019
* Added support for resolving Azure KeyVault references retrieved from configuration store.
* Fixed the following bugs in the implementation of on-demand refresh mechanism.
    * Configuration was updated on each refresh invocation if refreshAll is enabled for a key that does not exist.
    * Key-values registered for refresh that were not included in `Use` might not always get loaded in the initial configuration load.
    * Key-values registered for refresh that were not included in `Use` might be loaded more than once if the client invoked `Use` more than once.
* Improved handling of fatal errors that can cause the application to be stuck in a crash loop as orchestrators attempt to restart the application. This helps avoid overloading the server with requests.
* Improved error message when using `ConnectWithManagedIdentity` when the required access to a configuration store is not set up.
* Updated retry strategy for server failures to use exponential backoff with jitter.
* Removed reference to the package `Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore`.

### 2.0.0-preview-009470001-1371 - August 06, 2019
* Fixed a bug which caused some application frameworks which use a custom synchronization context, like ASP.NET, to hang when building the configuration provider.

### v2.0.0-preview-009200001-1437 - July 10, 2019
* Replaced watch feature with on-demand refresh mechanism to address the following fundamental design flaws.
    * Watch could not be invoked on-demand.
    * It continued to run in the background even in applications that could be considered inactive.
    * It promoted constant polling of configuration rather than a more intelligent approach of updating configuration when applications are active or need to ensure freshness.
* Added refresh mechanism to allow on-demand configuration updates with an internal cache.
* Removed `Watch` and `WatchAndReloadAll` methods.
* Added `ConfigureRefresh` method to configure dynamic refresh for configuration settings.
* Added `GetRefresher` method to retrieve an `IConfigurationRefresher` to trigger manual refresh in code.

### v1.0.0-preview-008920001-990 - June, 11 2019
* Added `TrimKeyPrefix` method to remove prefixes from the list of returned key-values from the config store.
* Improved durability on Watch, so that transient network errors do not cause the process to detach.
* Added additional retries on network error when using `ConnectWithManagedIdentity`.
* Enabled Correlation-Context for request-tracing.
    * ***Request-Tracing can be disabled by setting the environment variable `AZURE_APP_CONFIGURATION_TRACING_DISABLED` to `True` or `1`***
    * Added tracing options for the following:
        * Hosting platform.
        * Differentiating Initialization and Watch requests.
* Improved feature flag to prevent removal of default query with `null` label. This allows the default query to be used in conjunction with feature flags.
