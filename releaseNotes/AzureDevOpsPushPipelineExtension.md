### v6.4.0 - November, 20 2023
* Support appending prefixes to feature flags.

### v6.3.0 - October, 13 2023
* Added capability to use workload identity federation for authentication.

### v5.0.0 - February, 02 2023
**Breaking Changes**
  - Updated the task to require Node.js 16. It previously required 10.
  - Updated the minimum supported azure pipeline agent version to [2.206.1](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases/tag/v2.206.1) or later. Previously it was [2.144.0](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases/tag/v2.144.0).
  - The behavior when importing configurations with JSON content types such as `application/json` or `application/vnd.mycustomresource+json` has changed. The properties in the provided configuration are serialized as JSON to respect the provided content type. Settings that are expected to end up as JSON serialized strings in App Configuration should now be specified as JSON objects. Additionally, the depth property should also be adjusted to match the expected depth the JSON structure will be flattened to.

    **Before**
    ```
    {  
      "app": "{\"uri\":\"https://keyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/secret\"}"
    }

    task: AzureAppConfigurationPush@4
    inputs:
      azureSubscription: '<subscription>'
      AppConfigurationEndpoint: '<store endpoint>'
      ....
      ContentType: 'application/vnd.microsoft.appconfig.keyvaultref+json;charset=utf-8'
    ```

    **After**
    ```
    {  
      "app": {
          "uri": "https://keyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/secret " 
        }
    }

    task: AzureAppConfigurationPush@5
    inputs:
      azureSubscription: '<subscription>'
      AppConfigurationEndpoint: '<store endpoint>'
      Depth: 1
      ....
      ContentType: 'application/vnd.microsoft.appconfig.keyvaultref+json;charset=utf-8'

    ```

  - Feature flag import now requires adherence to the [feature management schema](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet/blob/release/v3/docs/schemas/FeatureManagement.v1.0.0.json). Settings with feature flag prefix and content type will fail to import
