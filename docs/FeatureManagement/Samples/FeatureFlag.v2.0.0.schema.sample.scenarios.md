### Validation of Rollout Percentage

The following tests are the baseline for testing the Feature Management libraries. These tests validate that the same formula is being used to calculate the rollout percentage. The modified files have a rollout percentage 1 higher than the original which takes Brittney from being disabled to enabled. So, the results of tests 12 through 19 should be True.
