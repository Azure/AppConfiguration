# Azure App Configuration Feature Management

Azure App Configuration provides feature management support through the creation of **Feature Flags**. These flags are stored in Azure App Configuration as key-values with a common set of conventions so that they can be identified among other non-feature flag key-values.

For more information, see [Feature Management](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement).
