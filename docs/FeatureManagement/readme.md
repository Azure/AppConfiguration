# Azure App Configuration Feature Management

Azure App Configuration provides feature management support through the creation of **Feature Flags**. Feature flags consist of a unique identifier and an enabled state that can be evaluated dynamically. These flags are stored in Azure App Configuration as key-values with a common set of conventions so that they can be identified among other non feature flag key-values.
